Searching Challenge
Have the function SearchingChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters.

For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.

Once your function is working, take the final output string and remove any characters (case-insensitive) from it that appear in your ChallengeToken. If the new final string is empty, return the string EMPTY.

Your ChallengeToken: 69svmglwc7
Examples
Input: "Hello apple pie"
Output: Hello
Final Output: Heo
Input: "No words"
Output: -1
Final Output: -1
